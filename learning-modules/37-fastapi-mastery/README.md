## 📚 **COMPLETE LEARNING PATH**

### **🎯 PHASE 1: FASTAPI FUNDAMENTALS (Week 1)**

#### **Day 1-2: FastAPI Basics**
**🔹 What You'll Learn:**
- FastAPI vs Flask vs Django comparison
- ASGI vs WSGI understanding
- Creating your first FastAPI application
- Path parameters and query parameters
- Request/response models with Pydantic

**🔹 Real-World Context:**
```python
# ❌ OLD WAY (Flask):
@app.route('/users/<int:user_id>')
def get_user(user_id):
    # No type checking, manual validation
    return {"user_id": user_id}

# ✅ FASTAPI WAY:
@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user(user_id: int) -> UserResponse:
    # Automatic type validation, async support
    return UserResponse(user_id=user_id)
```

#### **Day 3-4: Advanced Request Handling**
**🔹 What You'll Learn:**
- Request body validation with Pydantic models
- File uploads and form data handling
- Headers, cookies, and dependency injection
- Error handling and custom exceptions
- Response models and status codes

**🔹 Netflix Example:**
```python
class MovieRequest(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=200)
    genre: List[str] = Field(..., min_items=1)
    rating: float = Field(..., ge=0, le=10)

@app.post("/movies/", response_model=MovieResponse)
async def create_movie(movie: MovieRequest):
    # Automatic validation, type conversion, documentation
    return await movie_service.create(movie)
```

- Password hashing and security
- CORS and security headers
- Rate limiting and API keys

**🔹 Uber Example:**
```python
@app.post("/rides/request")
async def request_ride(
    ride_data: RideRequest,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    rate_limit: None = Depends(RateLimiter(times=10, seconds=60))
):
    # Authenticated, rate-limited endpoint
    return await ride_service.create_ride(ride_data, current_user)
```

#### **Day 3-4: Background Tasks & Async**
**🔹 What You'll Learn:**
- Background tasks with BackgroundTasks
- Celery integration for heavy processing
- Async/await best practices
- WebSocket support for real-time features
- Server-Sent Events (SSE)

#### **Day 5-7: Testing & Documentation**
**🔹 What You'll Learn:**
- Testing FastAPI applications with pytest
- Mocking dependencies and databases
- API documentation customization
- Performance testing and profiling
- Logging and monitoring integration

---

### **🎯 PHASE 3: ADVANCED PATTERNS (Week 3)**

#### **Day 1-2: Microservices Architecture**
**🔹 What You'll Learn:**
- Service-to-service communication
- API Gateway patterns
- Circuit breakers and retries
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Distributed tracing

**🔹 Microsoft Azure Example:**
```python
# ML Model Serving API
@app.post("/predict")
async def predict(
    data: PredictionRequest,
    model: MLModel = Depends(get_model),
    tracer: Tracer = Depends(get_tracer)
):
    with tracer.start_span("prediction"):
        result = await model.predict(data.features)
        return PredictionResponse(prediction=result)
```

#### **Day 3-4: Performance Optimization**
**🔹 What You'll Learn:**
- Async database connection pooling
- Caching strategies (Redis, in-memory)
- Response compression and streaming
- Database query optimization
- Memory profiling and optimization

#### **Day 5-7: Deployment & DevOps**
