🏴‍☠️ SOLID PRINCIPLES MASTERY - PROFESSIONAL CODE DESIGN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎯 WHAT YOU'LL LEARN BY CODING THIS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ S - Single Responsibility Principle
✅ O - Open/Closed Principle  
✅ L - Liskov Substitution Principle
✅ I - Interface Segregation Principle
✅ D - Dependency Inversion Principle

💰 SALARY IMPACT: +$60K-?20K (SOLID principles = senior engineer)
🏢 COMPANIES: All FAANG and enterprise companies require SOLID knowledge

📚 SOLID PRINCIPLES EXPLAINED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 S - SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE:
"A class should have only one reason to change"
• Each class should do ONE thing well
• Separate concerns into different classes
• Makes code easier to test and maintain

🔓 O - OPEN/CLOSED PRINCIPLE:
"Open for extension, closed for modification"
• Add new features without changing existing code
• Use inheritance and composition
• Prevents breaking existing functionality

🔄 L - LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE:
"Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types"
• Child classes should work wherever parent works
• Don't break the contract of the parent class
• Maintain expected behavior

🔌 I - INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE:
"Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use"
• Create small, focused interfaces
• Don't force classes to implement unused methods
• Better than one large interface

⬆️ D - DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE:
"Depend on abstractions, not concretions"
• High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules
• Both should depend on abstractions
• Use dependency injection

🔧 SOLID IN PRACTICE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ BAD (Violates SOLID):
class Character:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def attack(self):
        pass
    
    def save_to_database(self):  # Violates SRP
        pass
    
    def send_email(self):  # Violates SRP
        pass

✅ GOOD (Follows SOLID):
class Character:  # Single responsibility: character data
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def attack(self):
        pass

class CharacterRepository:  # Single responsibility: data persistence
    def save(self, character):
        pass

class NotificationService:  # Single responsibility: notifications
    def send_email(self, message):
        pass

"""
📚 SRP EXPLAINED WITH ONE PIECE:
Instead of one massive "Character" class that handles everything,
we separate concerns into focused classes.

BAD: Character class that handles combat, data storage, notifications, etc.
GOOD: Separate classes for each responsibility

📚 OCP EXPLAINED WITH ONE PIECE:
When new Devil Fruits are introduced, we shouldn't modify existing code.
We should be able to add new fruits by extending, not modifying.

BAD: Modify existing DevilFruit class for each new fruit

Don't force characters to implement abilities they don't have.
